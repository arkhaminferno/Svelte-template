# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.



### How do I get set up? ###

Clone and enter repository:


```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:meld-gold/frontend/partner.git
cd partner
```

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn 
```

to start the project (build first)

```bash
yarn run build
```
and then

```bash
yarn run dev
```


Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.
